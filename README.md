# CTRL-ModelPredictiveControl
## kgfbarbosa's Model Predictive Control Learning Archive

This repository is a **personal, academic, and professional** archive that brings together code, projects, and notes developed by me as part of my continuous learning and practice with **MPC (Model Predictive Control)**.

---

## Objectives

The goals of this repository are:

- To document my journey in studying and using model predictive controllers;  
- To consolidate a personal technical reference base;  
- To structure projects with clear and reusable documentation;  
- To share experiences under an open license;  
- To showcase my technical proficiency for academic and professional purposes.

This repository includes:

- Concept and functionality tests;  
- Complete or in-progress projects;  
- Sketches, experiments, and implementations based on tutorials.

> **Note:** This repository is a collection of studies with an educational and exploratory focus — not for commercial use. The code may not be finalized or optimized for production.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Language:** MATLAB;
- **Tools:** MATLAB 2023b + Simulink.

## Repository Structure

The structure may evolve over time as I add new tests or reorganize files. Generally, it is organized by the semesters during which I worked on the repo, with folders for each project or experiment (including code, constraints, simulations, and notes when necessary).

The repository also includes the `README` and `LICENSE` files.
